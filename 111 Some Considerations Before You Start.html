            <h4><strong>Welcome to the Final Course Exam!</strong></h4>

<p>A finalexam is the perfect way to wrap up this course, because it willallowyou to check if youwalk away from the course with a true knowledge of JavaScript programming.</p>





<p>Throughout the course, you havetested your practical knowledge of JavaScript during the coding challenges and during the projects. So this exam focuses more on the theoretical part of the course.</p>





<p><br></p>





<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">Exam goal:</strong> Testing if you truly understood the fundamental concepts behind the JavaScript language, as well as some practical applications.</p>





<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">Exam format:</strong> 30 multiple-choicequestions with 4 options each, are waiting for you. Only one answer is 100% correct.</p>





<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">Exam duration:</strong>Take approximately30-60 minutes to complete the exam, and do it all in one sitting. Try to not interrupt the exam if not necessary, so that you don't loose focus.If you need more time, it's no problem, take as much time as you need.</p>





<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">Exam difficulty:</strong>Before you start, please note that some of these questions are rather difficult on purpose, so that you can test if you <em>really</em> understood the course material. <strong class="redactor-inline-converted">It's really no problem if you fail some of the questions!</strong></p>





<p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">Exam rules:</strong> Please try to not cheat ;) It's better to fail a few questions and then review the material after that. You can, and should, take the exam more than once, until everything is crystal clear!</p>





<p><br></p>





<p>I hope that you take the exam, as Idesigned it carefully so that you can review the entire course in less that one hour.</p>





<p>So, good luck!</p>





<p>You can post your score in the Q&amp;A after you completed the exam :)</p>
